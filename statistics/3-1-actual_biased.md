[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

>> My Python code for this exercise is in /ThinkStats2/code/Elena_ThinkStats2_Ch3Ex1.py

>> *The output is:*  
>> Actual mean 1.02420515504  
>> Observed mean 2.40367910066

>> *Here I wanted to insert the image of two distributions.
>> The syntax is ![Ch3 ex1: Actual vs. Biased Distributions](link to the image Ch3_ex1.png in /dsp/Images/)  
>> Problem. Apparently I need to have my image uploaded somewhere to have the link. The natural place would be the current repo, but I failed add the image to it due to git.*

>> **Actual mean** is the mean of the actual distribution of number of children in families.  
>> **Observed mean** is the mean of the distribution of number of kids in families as observed by the kids, where the probability associated with each family size is “biased” by the number of kids in the family. if you survey a group of children and ask them how many siblings they have including themselves, you will get a biased distribution with the mean being greater than the actual mean.  
>> The **actual** and **observed** means computed above show the difference demonstrating the “class size paradox.”
