[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> My Python code for this exercise is in /ThinkStats2/code/Elena_ThinkStats2_Ch4Ex2.py

>> *The output is:*  

I've generated two sequences of random numbers to compare their performance by looking at their means, cdfs, and pmfs.  
mean1 0.5052638956385319  
mean2 0.5170552035820148  
The probability of the mean1 0.505264 is 0.479000  
The probability of the mean2 0.517055 is 0.508000  
Percentales of cdf1 (25, 50, 75, 100):  
0.253664731321 0.524204791003 0.747000939185 0.998594116156  
Percentales of cdf2 (25, 50, 75, 100):  
0.275613491131 0.508626420166 0.767363652792 0.996918653995
