[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> My Python code for this exercise is in /ThinkStats2/code/Elena_ThinkStats2_Ch4Ex2.py

>> *The out put is:*  

>> I've generated two sequences of random numbers to compare their performance by looking at their means, cdfs, and pmfs.  
>> mean1 0.5178100250446412  
>> mean2 0.4791650467653473  
>> The probability of the mean1 0.517810 is 0.479000  
>> The probability of the mean2 0.479165 is 0.500000  
>> Percentales of cdf1 (25, 50, 75, 100):  
>> 0.264915337506 0.544680725002 0.754282248046 0.99959255206  
>> Percentales of cdf2 (25, 50, 75, 100):  
>> 0.213225691775 0.479014010133 0.733122456131 0.997034275121
