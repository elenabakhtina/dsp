[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Python code for this exercise is in /ThinkStats2/code/Elena_ThinkStats2_Ch2Ex4.py

>> The output is:  
>> Mean of the weights of first babies 7.201094430437772  
>> Mean of the weights of other babies 7.325855614973262  
>> The difference in weights b/w first children and others using Cohen's D stats is -0.088672927072602  
  
>> As per internet, *Cohen suggested that d=0.2 be considered a 'small' effect size, 0.5 represents a 'medium' effect size and 0.8 a 'large' effect size.* Thus, d=0.09 is very small.
